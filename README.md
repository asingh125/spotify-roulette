# Spotify Roulette

## Welcome to Spotify Roulette, a game where you try to guess your friends' music taste!

Each round, a song from a different player's playlist will show up on the screen, and each player must guess whose they think it came from. The person with the most correct guesses at the end of the game wins.

To start playing, create an account with your username, password, and a link to your favorite Spotify playlist. Make sure to link this account to your Spotify account once you're logged in. Have fun!
